# Spring Boot Order Management Backend

This project is a robust Spring Boot application for managing customer orders, products, and shipments.

The order-backend is designed to provide a comprehensive solution for e-commerce businesses to handle their order processing workflow. It offers a set of RESTful APIs that allow for the creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of orders, and shipments. The application is built with a focus on scalability and maintainability, following domain-driven design principles and a clean architecture approach.




Key features of this application include:
- Order processing and tracking
- Shipment management

The application leverages Spring Boot 3.2.3 and Java 17, providing a modern and efficient foundation for building enterprise-grade applications. It also includes Spring Data JPA for data persistence, allowing for easy interaction with the underlying database.

### Key Files:
- `OrderBackendApplication.java`: The main entry point for the Spring Boot application.
- `Dockerfile`: Contains instructions for building a Docker image of the application.
- `locustfile.py`: Defines load testing scenarios using Locust.
- `pom.xml`: Maven project configuration file specifying dependencies and build settings.

### Important Integration Points:
- REST API endpoints in the `api` package
- Database connections handled by Spring Data JPA repositories in the `infra/repository` package
- AWS S3 integration for object storage

## Usage Instructions

### Installation

Prerequisites:
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 17
- Maven 3.6+
- Docker (optional, for containerization)

Steps:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd order-backend
   ```

2. Build the project:
   ```
   mvn clean package
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```
   java -jar target/order-backend-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
   ```

### Getting Started

Once the application is running, you can interact with it using HTTP requests to the exposed endpoints. Here are some example curl commands:

1. Create a new customer:
   ```
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/customers -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name":"John Doe","email":"john@example.com","address":"123 Main St","username":"johndoe","password":"password123"}'
   ```

2. Get all orders:
   ```
   curl http://localhost:8080/orders
   ```

3. Create a new order:
   ```
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/orders -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"customerId":1,"items":[{"productId":1,"quantity":2}]}'
   ```

### Configuration Options

The application can be configured using properties in the `application.properties` file. Key configuration options include:

- `spring.datasource.url`: Database connection URL
- `spring.datasource.username`: Database username
- `spring.datasource.password`: Database password
- `aws.s3.region`: AWS region for S3 integration
- `aws.s3.bucket`: S3 bucket name for object storage

### Testing & Quality

To run the unit tests:

```
mvn test
```

For load testing using Locust:

1. Install Locust:
   ```
   pip install locust
   ```

2. Run the Locust file:
   ```
   locust -f locustfile.py
   ```

3. Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:8089` to access the Locust web interface.

### Troubleshooting

Common Issue: Application fails to start
- Problem: The application throws an exception during startup.
- Error Message: "Could not create connection to database server"
- Diagnostic Steps:
  1. Check if the database server is running and accessible.
  2. Verify the database connection details in `application.properties`.
  3. Ensure the database user has the necessary permissions.
- Solution: Correct the database configuration in `application.properties` or start the database server if it's not running.

Debugging:
- To enable debug logging, add the following to `application.properties`:
  ```
  logging.level.com.example.orderbackend=DEBUG
  ```
- Log files are typically located in the `logs` directory in the project root.
- Ensure you have the necessary permissions to read log files.

Performance Optimization:
- Monitor database query performance using Spring Boot Actuator endpoints.
- Use the `/actuator/metrics` endpoint to view application metrics.
- Consider adding database indexes for frequently queried fields to improve response times.

## Data Flow

The order-backend application follows a typical request-response flow:

1. Client sends an HTTP request to an API endpoint.
2. The request is received by the corresponding controller in the `api` package.
3. The controller delegates the business logic to the appropriate service in the `application/service` package.
4. The service interacts with the domain model and repositories to perform the required operations.
5. Data is persisted or retrieved using the repository implementations in the `infra/repository` package.
6. The service processes the data and returns the result to the controller.
7. The controller formats the response and sends it back to the client.

```
[Client] <-> [API Controller] <-> [Application Service] <-> [Domain Service] <-> [Repository] <-> [Database]
                                                         <-> [Domain Model]
```

Note: The application also integrates with AWS S3 for object storage, which may be involved in certain data flows.

## Deployment

Prerequisites:
- Docker
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate permissions

Deployment Steps:
1. Build the Docker image:
   ```
   docker build -t order-backend .
   ```

2. Tag the image for AWS ECR:
   ```
   docker tag order-backend:latest $AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$AWS_REGION.amazonaws.com/order/order-backend:latest
   ```

3. Push the image to AWS ECR:
   ```
   docker push $AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$AWS_REGION.amazonaws.com/order/order-backend:latest
   ```

4. Deploy the application using your preferred AWS service (e.g., ECS, EKS, or Elastic Beanstalk).

Environment Configuration:
- Set the following environment variables in your deployment environment:
  - `SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL`
  - `SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME`
  - `SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD`
  - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
  - `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
  - `AWS_REGION`

Monitoring:
- Use AWS CloudWatch for log monitoring and metrics collection.
- Set up alarms for critical metrics such as CPU usage, memory utilization, and error rates.
